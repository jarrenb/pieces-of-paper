responsive pieces of paper using css grid

determine responsive pieces of paper using css grid. the point being that html content on a browser page could be "paperified" automatically (transferred to a design that looks like pieces of paper and the content would fit automatically within a piece, and move to the next piece when it ran of out room automatically)

a mobile piece of paper can either show all of the text really small (the entire piece of paper fits within the display) or it can show the text as readable, and just show the border of where the paper would be (this would make for really long pieces of paper) but one would still know when they've moved to a new page

one piece of paper would always be 1:1 scale with a print preview and printed page. the user would know "if i hit print, the content of this page would all fit on one actual piece of paper". so, if they're looking at a document that had four pages, they'd know that if they hit cmd + p or ctrl + p their printer would spit out four pieces of paper

also certain word processing or document presentation functionality should be included in this project. automatic page numbers and other common header and footer info could be toggled on and off according to user choice
